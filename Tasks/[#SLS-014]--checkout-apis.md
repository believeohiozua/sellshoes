#### Checkout APIs

The Checkout APIs will handle the end-to-end checkout process, allowing users to seamlessly transition from their cart to order creation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the required functionalities:  

---

#### 1. **Retrieve Cart Items**  
   - Fetch all items in the user's cart, including:  
     - Product names, quantities, and prices.  
     - Total cost of the items in the cart.  
   - Validate that the cart is not empty before proceeding to the next steps.  

#### 2. **Shipping Address and Cost Calculation**  
   - **Shipping Address:**  
     - Accept the user's shipping address as input.  
     - Validate the address format (e.g., postal code, city, country).  
   - **Shipping Cost Calculation:**  
     - Use the shipping address to calculate the shipping cost based on predefined logic (e.g., flat rate, distance-based, or weight-based).  
     - Add the shipping cost to the total checkout amount.  

#### 3. **Payment Processing**  
   - **Collect Payment Details:**  
     - Accept the user's card details (e.g., card number, expiration date, CVV).  
     - Validate the payment details before processing.  
   - **Stripe Integration:**  
     - Use the Stripe payment gateway to securely process the payment.  
     - Handle payment success or failure:
       - **On Success:** Generate a success response with the transaction ID and payment details.  
       - **On Failure:** Return an error message with details about the failure (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid card).  
   - Ensure sensitive card information is not stored in the database.  

#### 4. **Order Creation and Storage**  
   - **Create Order:**  
     - After successful payment, create a new order in the database with the following details:  
       - User ID.  
       - Items purchased (product IDs, quantities, and prices).  
       - Shipping address and cost.  
       - Total amount paid (including shipping).  
       - Payment status and transaction ID from Stripe.  
   - **Save Order:**  
     - Persist the order details in the database for future reference and tracking.

### Workflow Overview  
1. **Step 1:** Validate the user's cart and retrieve all items.  
2. **Step 2:** Accept and validate the user's shipping address, then calculate the shipping cost.  
3. **Step 3:** Collect and validate payment details, then process the payment using Stripe.  
4. **Step 4:** Upon payment success, create and store the order in the database.

### Notes  
- The API should handle errors gracefully at every step, returning meaningful messages to the user (e.g., "Invalid shipping address," "Payment failed").  
- Ensure all operations are atomic where needed to prevent partial updates (e.g., if payment fails, do not create an order).  
- Payment processing and sensitive user data must comply with security standards (e.g., PCI DSS for card payments).
